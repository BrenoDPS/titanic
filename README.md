# Titanic Challenge Notebook ReadMe

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that addresses the Titanic challenge from Kaggle. The goal of the challenge is to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, sex, class, etc.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/titanic-challenge/
│
├── data/
│   ├── train.csv
│   ├── test.csv
│   └── gender_submission.csv
│
├── notebooks/
│   └── Titanic_Challenge_Notebook.ipynb
│
├── models/
│   └── titanic_model.pkl
│
├── reports/
│   ├── figures/
│   │   └── correlation_matrix.png
│   └── results.md

├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

- `data/`: Contains the datasets provided by Kaggle for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook that walks through the problem-solving process.
- `models/`: Stores the serialized model after training.
- `reports/`: Contains figures and results generated from the notebook.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the contents and usage of the repository.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the notebook.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-challenge.git
   cd titanic-challenge
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open and run the notebook:**

   In the Jupyter interface, navigate to `notebooks/Titanic_Challenge_Notebook.ipynb` and run all cells to execute the code and reproduce the analysis and results.

## Project Description

The notebook is structured into several key sections:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the Titanic challenge and the objectives.
2. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loading the dataset and performing initial exploration and visualization.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
4. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Analyzing the performance of the models using various metrics and visualizations.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and the performance of the best model.
7. **Saving the Model**: Serializing the trained model for future use.

## Running Tests

To ensure the integrity of the project, you can run the tests included in the repository. Follow these steps:

1. **Install testing dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Run the tests:**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

The tests will automatically discover and run any test files in the repository, ensuring that the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps are functioning correctly.
